# The When of Python

The When of Python is a fledgling community initiative. The goal is to
effectively shrink Python so it fits our brains by providing guidance
on when we should use particular language features (and when we should
not).

This site catalogues Python's features to provide guidance on when
they should be used.

* Browse the catalogue of Python features in the left hand sidebar.
* Search for a particular feature using the search bar in the top left
  of this page.

The When of Python organises Python's features into three broad
categories:

## <a class="status common">Common Python</a>

Firstly, Common Python comprises features we should all know so we can
basically read each other's work. Clarity on this will be especially
useful for teachers and anyone learning Python.

## <a class="status situational">Situational Python</a>

Secondly, Situational Python comprises features that are useful but not for
everyone or not all the time. It depends on the situation, for
example:

* Web development might need very different features than scientific Python, e.g. asyncio
* Advanced library code might need advanced features, e.g. low-level threading / multi-processing

For each feature we try to provide guidance on what the situations are
where it is the preferred One Obvious Way. The situations might be
defined by domain (e.g. web application development vs data science)
or type of code (e.g. scripting vs code with enterprise
responsibilities).

## <a class="status deprecated">Deprecated Python</a>

Finally, Deprecated Python comprises features we should avoid using.
And maybe we should go even further than that - perhaps working
through existing code and expunging some features in favour of better
alternatives.
